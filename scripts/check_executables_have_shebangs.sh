# We only need this because the default hook found in
# https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks on version 6.0.0 with id
# `check-executables-have-shebangs` does not run reliably in Docker containers:
# sometimes it reports non-executable files as executable files missing the
# shebang. We traced it back to Python's `os.access(path, os.X_OK)`
# returning `True` for non-executables files, and we don't know whether that's
# a bug or not. That makes the `identify` library report files that are not
# executable as such. Thus, `pre-commit` passes non-executable files to its
# script, and the script returns errors (it doesn't check again whether those
# files are executable, it just trusts `identify`).

# Detect OS to use the correct `stat` format.
